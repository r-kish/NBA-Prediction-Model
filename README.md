# Introduction
The NBA Stats website hosts one of the most detailed data repositories that are publicly available on the Internet, providing exact details regarding atheletes and teams for any season, or any game. This project began as a data analysis exercise to try techniques I've used in other domains; however it turned into a prediction modeling project as I dug deeper into the data provided. 

My initial analysis looked at career performance insights for all NBA atheletes with All-NBA and All-Star status, specifically looking at point averages and the time it took to achieve their elite status from when they were drafted. I later got into analyzing career outcomes of all NBA atheletes during a specific time-range, comparing it to data regarding individual season outcomes for these atheletes, and visualizing the distribution of season outcomes for each career outcome pool. The percentages and information from this analysis is the basis for a prediction model I am still currently developing which will be able to predict career outcomes of NBA athletes who were newly drafted using historic data on veteran players.
